Medical image analysis plays a central role in the early detection and treatment planning of brain tumors. In recent years, deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in automating the segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of the application of U-Net, a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation in the accurate delineation of brain tumors. The proposed methodology uses a U-Net model trained on a diverse dataset of annotated brain MRI scans to achieve robust segmentation results. The U-Net architecture features a contraction path for feature extraction and an expansion path for precise localization, facilitating the extraction of complex tumor boundaries while preserving spatial context. The model is trained to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor regions, allowing accurate identification and segmentation. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, extensive experiments were conducted on benchmark datasets and the results were compared with state-of-the-art segmentation methods. The results show that the U-Net model consistently outperforms existing techniques and exhibits good accuracy and efficiency in brain tumor segmentation. The implications of this study extend beyond improving diagnostic accuracy to potential advances in treatment planning and monitoring. The robustness and versatility of the U-Net architecture make it a promising tool for automated brain tumor segmentation, contributing to improved clinical workflow and ultimately improved patient outcomes in the field of neuro-oncology.
